        <p>Ankarada doğdum.Kütahya fen lisesinden sonra İTÜ İnşaat Mühde 2018-2020 yılları arasında eğitim adldım. Mimar sinanda 2018 yılından beri Mimarlık okumaktayım.I am a London-based architect, designer and photographer, with a special interest in information technologies. Currently a doctoral researcher at The Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL, my work contributes to the debate surrounding the trustworthiness of digital media and the role of the built environment in informing the public.
    
            Born in Istanbul, I hold a Professional Architecture Degree (B Arch) from Istanbul Technical University, and Post-Professional Architecture MS from Pratt Institute, New York. During my undergraduate I spent one year at Politecnico di Milano and I recently completed a visiting researcher program at Yale University School of Architecture.
            
            My work has been exhibited internationally including at the Media Architecture Biennale and London Design Festival. You can find about my recent publications here.
            Also, the html/css codes are written by myself. Please let me know how I did!
